DB Function
- SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
- ROUND(), LENGTH(), uCASE(), LCASE
- YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY(), DAYOFMONTH(), DAYOFWEEK(), DAYOFYEAR(), WEEK(), HOUR(), MINUTE(), SECOND()

Overcome limitations of agg func by sub-queries and nested selects

Sub-queries & nested selects    # can be used when multi tables
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY
FROM employees
WHERE SALARY < (select AVG(SALARY)  #here
                from employees);

SELECT EMP_ID, SALARY, (select MAX(SALARY) FROM employees ) AS MAX_SALARY  #here
FROM employees;

select * from employees where JOB_ID <talbe1> IN (select JOB_IDENT from jobs <table2> where JOB_TITLE= 'Jr. Designer');

Multitables

Implicit Join

SELECT * FROM <table1> A, <table2> B
WHERE <A.column1> = <B.column2>;    #A, B are short aliases for faster input, can use whole name

view is an alternative way of representing data that exists in one or more tables,
are fields from one or more real tables in the database

CREATE or REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_1, table_2
WHERE condition;


Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used to read and modify data in tables. These are also sometimes referred to as CRUD operations,
that is, Create, Read, Update and Delete rows in a table. Common DML statement types include INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE

1.1 SELECT *(all) / column1, column2,
FROM table_name

1.2 WHERE <COL> e.g. LIKE "A%" / Range / ... or ... equivalent to <COL> in ("value", "value")#String pattern, returns when <COL> starts with A
# NOT LIKE
# "%A% anywhere in <COL>
# "__A%" starts with 3rd position
# can't use agg function in WHERE clause

sub-queries to evaluate agg func

1.3 ORDER BY <COL1> DESC, <COL2> #ordered in descending order by <COL1> & within order by <COL2> in ASEC
# can use number 1, 2, 3 to specify which col if multiple col called

1.4 GROUP BY <COL>
SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

1.4.1 HAVING <PREDICATE> #ONLY WORKS FOR GROUP BY, unlike where clause works for whole result set

1.5 COUNT()
SELECT COUNT(*) from FilmLocations where ReleaseYear < 1950;

1.6 DISTINCT    #retrieve unique value
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ReleaseYear) FROM FilmLocations WHERE ProductionCompany="Warner Bros. Pictures";

1.7LIMIT #similar to .head()
SELECT * FROM FilmLocations LIMIT 15 OFFSET 10; #retrieve first 15 rows starting from 11th row

1.8
INSERT INTO <tablename> VALUES
("xx" , "XX", ...),    #first row
("xx", "XX", ...), ...    #2nd row


DELETE from <Table> WHERE <Predicate>



Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define, change, or drop database objects such as tables
Common DDL statement types include CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, and DROP

2.1 CREATE
CREATE TABLE Student(Name VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
                    Gender CHAR(6)); # Primary Keys  constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table, can help speed up your queries significantly
INSERT into Student VALUES('Herry', 'Male');
INSERT into Student VALUES('Mahi', 'Female');
SELECT LENGTH(Name) FROM Student;

# VAR() used when data values is of fixed length(size), if less than fixed length padded with extra memory space
# varchar(60) used when data values is of var length(size), w/o padded extra space, performance not as good as CHAR()

2.2 ALTER #change str of existing table e.g. add, modify, drop

2.2.1
ALTER <table>
ADD <column> <dtype> column_constraint;     #ADD COLUMN

2.2.2
#then add in new data
UPDATE <table> SET <column=xx> WHERE <predicate>

2.2.3
ALTER <table>
DROP <column>;    #del col

2.2.4
ALTER <table>
ALTER <column> SET <dtype>;   #alter col dtype

2.2.5
ALTER <table>
RENAME <column> current_column_name TO new_column_name;   #rename col name

2.3
DROP <table>
# del all data and table

2.4
TRUNCATE <table>
    IMMEDIATE:\;
# del all data but keep table
